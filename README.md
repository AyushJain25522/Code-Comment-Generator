# Code Comment Generator
 A mini-project I created during my 3rd semester.
 
This project leverages the OpenAI API to generate comments for a given piece of code. 
Since it uses the OpenAI API, it can generate comments for code written in almost any programming language. 
In addition to generating comments, it also provides a code summary, offering a brief explanation of the code.
